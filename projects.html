		<p>During my senior year at Southern Oregon University (SOU) I teamed up with another student to develop the Web Search Companion (WSC), our Capstone Project. The client requested an internet search application with the following features: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>the ability to locate online topics, </li>
			<li>save and store the topic results for future use and </li>
			<li>return to the results later for user updates</li>
		</ul>

		<p>WSC was designed as a substitute to an existing Google search feature that the client didn’t feel was reliable enough for him. Also, the team decided to focus on functional development as opposed to the user interface (UI), so the UI was purposefully left undecorated.</p>

		<p>Development was done in sprints and then presented to the product owner for suggested improvements. See a description of the entire project in the

		<p>For six months, I worked on a team at 
		<a href="https://dymaptic.com/" target="_blank" style="color:lightBlue">Dymaptic</a> that developed features for a tablet application used by field workers of an oil and gas construction company who were unable to access wi-fi connections. The app recorded GIS survey points to inspect underground pipelines and document their condition for integrity management plans demonstrating compliance to safety regulations.  Once recorded by the app, the information was then uploaded to an on-premise DynamoDB database. Survey data included images, electric current readings and field notes.</p>
		
		<p>As a member of the coding team, I enjoyed collaborating with my teammates to create useful products that helped people get their jobs done. I received new feature assignments in sprint rounds, developed code, and did unit testing. I also worked on an in-house project that used the <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home" target="_blank" style="color:lightBlue"> ESRI </a> software ArcGIS Online and open source resources on GitHub.</p>
		
		<p>I would like to do more with GIS data.

		<p>I’m happiest when I’m learning something new. Going to school for 6 years in IT classes exposed me to many different types of languages and solution spaces. One thing I realized is that there is always more than one way to solve a coding problem! </p>
		
		<p>Lately, I’ve delved into CSS to create this website and it’s been fun to go deeper than just doing a super simple UI. I’m no front end UX designer, but I have enjoyed the website development experience. In fact, I’m starting an online course to gain a certification as a full stack Javascript developer so I can be comfortable with all the layers of web development including React libraries and the Angular Framework. Since I already have experience with MySQL and PHP query languages, I should be able to handle the integration of back end technology with a little practice. Stay tuned for another project tile on this page. </p>
